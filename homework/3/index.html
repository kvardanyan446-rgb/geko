        <p>News
A news website covers current events, politics, entertainment, sports, and other topics of interest. Major news outlets like BBC, NPR, CNN, and Fox News all have large websites (and often mobile apps as well). News sites are often regularly updated throughout the day to keep readers informed. While many news websites are freely accessible, some content and articles may be hidden behind a paywall that requires readers to pay for a monthly or annual subscription.
